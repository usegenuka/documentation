Webhooks allow your application to receive **real-time notifications** from Genuka whenever specific events occur (e.g., an order is created, or an order is canceled).  
Instead of continuously polling the API, Genuka will automatically send an HTTP request to your configured webhook endpoint whenever an event happens.

---

## How Webhooks Work

1. You create and deploy your application with a publicly accessible URL.  
2. Inside your **Genuka Developer Dashboard**, configure one or multiple webhook endpoints.  
3. When an event occurs, Genuka sends a `POST` request with a JSON payload to your endpoint.  
4. Your application processes the event (e.g., updating order status, sending notifications, etc.).  

---

## Example webhook payload

When an order is created, Genuka may send a payload similar to this:

```json
{
  "event": "order.created",
  "data": {
    "id": "ord_12345",
    "amount": 15000,
    "currency": "XAF",
    "status": "pending",
    "customer": {
      "name": "Alice Example",
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "phone": "+237600000000"
    },
    "reference": "order_test_001",
    "created_at": "2025-08-20T12:34:56Z"
  }
}
```

## Securing Your Webhooks

To ensure the payload really comes from Genuka:

Always check the request headers for a signature key (to be provided in the Genuka dashboard).

Validate the event type (event field) before processing.

Ensure your endpoint uses HTTPS for secure communication.

## Example Webhook Handler (Nextjs)

```typescript
// app/api/webhook/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const body = await req.json();

    switch (body.event) {
      case "order.created":
        console.log("‚úÖ New order received:", body.data);
        break;
      case "order.completed":
        console.log("üéâ Order completed:", body.data);
        break;
      default:
        console.log("‚ö†Ô∏è Unhandled event:", body.event);
    }

    // Always acknowledge reception
    return NextResponse.json({ received: true }, { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("‚ùå Error handling webhook:", error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Invalid payload" },
      { status: 400 }
    );
  }
}
```
