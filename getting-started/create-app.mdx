This guide explains the process of creating your application, and deploying it.  

<Steps>
  <Step title="Overview">
    Before your integration can go live, you need to:

- Build your application (backend and/or frontend).
- Configure your webhooks and callback URLs.
- Deploy it to a publicly accessible server.
- Submit the application details to Genuka for review and approval.

Once approved, your application will be allowed to interact with the Genuka API in production in our store.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Application requirements">
    When creating an application, make sure it follows these guidelines:
    - Publicly accessible: Your app must be hosted on a secure (HTTPS) server accessible over the internet.
    - Stable environment: Avoid using temporary services; ensure uptime and reliability.
    - Webhooks support: If your integration requires receiving real-time notifications (e.g., order updates, customers and other), expose valid webhook endpoints.
    - Data security: Handle all credentials (API keys, access tokens) securely.

    When creating your application, you will specify the modules you want to have access to, we will develop this in the following sections

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an application">
    - Use your preferred technology stack (Node.js, PHP, Python, Java, etc.).
    - Integrate with the **Genuka API** following the authentication and endpoint documentation.
    - Implement the required business logic (e.g., syncing products, processing orders, handling events).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare Webhooks (Optional but Recommended)">
   If your application must react to Genuka events (like order created, order updated, payment status changed):

    - Implement endpoints such as:
      - `POST https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/`
      - `POST https://yourdomain.com/callback/`

    - Ensure these endpoints:
      - Accept `POST` requests with JSON payloads.
      - Respond quickly with `200 OK`.
      - Validate signatures (if required for security).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Your Application">
      - Deploy your application on a secure production server.
      - Ensure it uses **HTTPS** (TLS/SSL).
      - Verify that all routes and webhook URLs are functional and reachable.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## 4. Submitting to Genuka

Once your app is ready:

1. Log in to your Genuka developer dashboard (or contact the integrations team).
2. Navigate to **App Submission**.
3. Provide the following details:
   - Application name
   - Public deployment link
   - Webhook URLs
   - Technical documentation (if available)
   - Contact information
4. Submit for **review and validation**.

## 5. Validation Process

- **Technical Review**: The Genuka team verifies that your endpoints are reachable and your app correctly integrates with the API.
- **Security Review**: Basic checks to ensure no sensitive data leaks or insecure endpoints.
- **Approval/Feedback**: 
  - If approved → You receive confirmation, and your app is whitelisted for production access.
  - If rejected → Feedback will be shared, and you can re-submit after corrections.

## 6. After Approval

Once approved:

- You can start using your **production API keys**.
- Your app will officially be recognized as a validated Genuka integration.
- You will be notified of future updates or changes affecting integrations.
