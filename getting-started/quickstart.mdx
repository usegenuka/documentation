# Getting Started with Genuka

Follow this step-by-step guide to create your developer account, register your first application, and make your first API call with Genuka.

---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Developer Account">
    Create your **Genuka developer account** and log in to your dashboard.\
    👉 [Register here](https://dev.genuka.com/login)

    ✅ Once logged in, you can access your developer dashboard to manage your applications and test integrations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your Application">
    From your developer dashboard, go to the **Applications** section or visit 👉 [Create an App](/getting-started/create-app).

    🎉 Once created, you’ll receive your:

    - **Public Key** — used for client-side operations
    - **Secret Key** — used for secure server-side authentication

    Keep your **Secret Key** private — it authenticates your server with Genuka’s API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Integration Method">
    You can integrate Genuka in **two ways**, depending on your stack:

    1. **Using the JavaScript SDK** _(Recommended for React, Angular, Vue, etc.)_

    Install the SDK in your project:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Using npm
    npm install genuka-api
    ```

    
    ```bash Using yarn
    yarn add genuka-api
    ```

    
    ```bash Using pnpm
    pnpm add genuka-api
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    Initialize the SDK in your app:

    ```javascript
    import Genuka from "genuka-api";
    
    const genuka = await Genuka.initialize({
      publicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
      secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
      adminMode: true,
    });
    
    const orders = await genuka.orders.list({ isAdmin: true });
    console.log({ orders });
    ```

    2. **Using the REST API directly**

    You can also interact directly with the API using `fetch`, `axios`, or cURL:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://api.genuka.com/orders/ \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

    ⚠️ **Important:**\
    When your app is installed by a client, Genuka will automatically provide it with a **unique access token** specific to that client.\
    This token must be used to authenticate all API calls made on behalf of that client.

    👉 For more details about how tokens are generated and managed, see [Authentication](/getting-started/authentication).

    👉 Choose the method that best fits your application stack.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Webhooks">
    To receive **real-time notifications** (e.g., when an order is created, updated, or completed), configure your webhook endpoint in the dashboard.\
    👉 [Webhook Setup Guide](/getting-started/webhook)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go Live 🚀">
    Once your app is tested and stable, switch to **live mode** from your dashboard and start processing real transactions.\
    👉 [Submit Your App](/getting-started/submit-app)
  </Step>
</Steps>
