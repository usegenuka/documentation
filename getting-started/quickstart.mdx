# Getting Started with Genuka

Follow this step-by-step guide to create your developer account, register your first application.

---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Developer Account">
    Create your **Genuka developer account** and log in to your dashboard.\
    ðŸ‘‰ [Register here](https://dev.genuka.com/login)

    Once logged in, you can access your developer dashboard to manage your applications and test integrations.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your Application">
    From your developer dashboard, go to the **Applications** section or visit ðŸ‘‰ [Create an App](/getting-started/create-app).

    ðŸŽ‰ Once created, youâ€™ll receive your:

    - **Public Key** â€” used for client-side operations
    - **Secret Key** â€” used for secure server-side authentication

    Keep your **Secret Key** private â€” it authenticates your server with Genukaâ€™s API.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Integration Method">
    You can integrate Genuka in **two ways**, depending on your stack:

    1. **Using the JavaScript SDK** _(Recommended for React, Angular, Vue, etc.)_

    Install the SDK in your project:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Using npm
    npm install genuka-api
    ```


    ```bash Using yarn
    yarn add genuka-api
    ```


    ```bash Using pnpm
    pnpm add genuka-api
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    Initialize the SDK in your app:

<Note>
  ðŸ’¡ `companyId` represents the ID of the company whose data you want to access.
  No worries â€” this ID is **automatically included with every request**, so
  thereâ€™s nothing extra you need to do. And hereâ€™s some good news â€” **your
  developer account automatically creates a default company**, making it easy to
  start testing your API calls right away.
</Note>

    ```javascript
    import Genuka from "genuka-api";

    const genuka = await Genuka.initialize({ id: companyId });

    const products = await genuka.products.list();
    console.log({ products });
    ```

    2. **Using the REST API directly**

    You can also interact directly with the API using `fetch`, `axios`, or cURL:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://api.genuka.com/2023-11/products/ \
    -H "x-company: companyId"
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Webhooks">
    Webhooks are **automatically created and triggered** for each relevant request, so your application will receive real-time notifications by default.  
    However, you can **customize your webhook settings** â€” for example, choose which events to listen to or where to send them â€” by following the guide below.  
    [Customize Webhooks Guide](/getting-started/webhook)
  </Step>

<Step title="Submit for Review ðŸ§©">
  After testing your app, submit it for review so the Genuka team can verify its compliance and functionality.  
  Our review process ensures that every app meets our **security, performance, and integration standards**.  
  If any issues are found, you'll receive a detailed notification explaining what needs to be fixed before approval.  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Submit Your App](/getting-started/submit-app)
</Step>

<Step title="Go Live ðŸš€">
  Once your app is approved, the Genuka team will **publish and release** it to the platform.  
  From your dashboard, you can then switch to **live mode** and start handling real merchant data and transactions.  
  Welcome to the Genuka ecosystem!
