# Getting Started with Genuka

Follow this step-by-step guide to create your developer account, register your first application.

---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Developer Account">
    Create your **Genuka developer account** and log in to your dashboard.\
    👉 [Register here](https://dev.genuka.com/login)

    Once logged in, you can access your developer dashboard to manage your applications and test integrations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your Application">
    From your developer dashboard, go to the **Applications** section or visit 👉 [Create an App](https://dev.genuka.com/).

    🎉 Once created, you’ll receive your:

    - **Public Key** — used for client-side operations
    - **Secret Key** — used for secure server-side authentication

    Keep your **Secret Key** private — it authenticates your server with Genuka’s API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Integration Method">
    You can integrate Genuka in **two ways**, depending on your stack:

    1. **Using the JavaScript SDK** _(Recommended for React, Angular, Vue, etc.)_

    Install the SDK in your project:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Using npm
    npm install genuka-api
    ```

    
    ```bash Using yarn
    yarn add genuka-api
    ```

    
    ```bash Using pnpm
    pnpm add genuka-api
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    Initialize the SDK in your app:

    <Note>
      💡 `companyId` represents the ID of the company whose data you want to access. No worries — this ID is **automatically included with every request**, so there’s nothing extra you need to do. And here’s some good news — **your
      developer account automatically creates a default company**, making it easy to start testing your API calls right away.
    </Note>
    ```javascript
    import Genuka from "genuka-api";
    
    const genuka = await Genuka.initialize({ adminMode: true });
    
    genuka.setCompanyId(YOUR_COMPANY_ID);
    genuka.setToken(YOUR_ACCES_TOKEN);
    
    const orders = genuka.orders.list({ isAdmin: true }),
    console.log({orders})
    ```

    2. **Using the REST API directly**

    You can also interact directly with the API using `fetch`, `axios`, or cURL:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://api.genuka.com/2023-11/products/ \
    -H "x-company: companyId" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ⚠️ **Important:**\
    When your app is installed by a client, Genuka will automatically provide it with a **hmac** specific to that client.\
    This hmac can be use to optain the _unique access token_ who is used to authenticate all API calls made on behalf of that client.

    👉 For more details about how tokens are generated and managed, see [Authentication](/getting-started/authentication).

    👉 Choose the method that best fits your application stack.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Webhooks">
    To receive **real-time notifications** (e.g., when an order is created, updated, or completed), configure your webhook endpoint in the dashboard.\
    👉 [Webhook Setup Guide](/getting-started/webhook)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit for Review 🧩">
    After testing your app, submit it for review so the Genuka team can verify its compliance and functionality.\
    Our review process ensures that every app meets our **security, performance, and integration standards**.\
    If any issues are found, you'll receive a detailed notification explaining what needs to be fixed before approval.\
    👉 [Submit Your App](/getting-started/submit-app)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go Live 🚀">
    Once your app is tested and stable, switch to **live mode** from your dashboard:

    1. Deploy your application on your server.
    2. Open your app in the Genuka dashboard.
    3. Click the **"Go to Live"** button.

    ✅ Your application will then enter an evaluation phase.\
    If the evaluation is positive (approved), it becomes immediately available on the **Genuka Store** for clients to install and use.
