# Getting Started with Genuka

Follow this step-by-step guide to create your developer account, configure your environment, and make your first API call with Genuka.

---

<Steps>
   <Step title="Create your developer account">
    Sign up for a **Genuka developer account** and log in to your dashboard.  
    ðŸ‘‰ [Register here](/api-reference/endpoint/authentication/register)

    Once registered, verify your email address to activate your account.

    âœ… After activation, you now have access to your [Genuka Platform](https://genuka.com) with the credentials you created.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Retrieve Your API Keys">
    After approval, navigate to your **Dashboard â†’ API Keys** to get your sandbox and live keys.  
    - Use **sandbox keys** for testing  
    - Use **live keys** when going into production

    ðŸ‘‰ [API Keys documentation](/dashboard/api-keys)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose your integration method">
    You can integrate Genuka in **two ways** depending on your project:

    1. **Using the JavaScript SDK (Recommended for React, Angular, Vue, etc.)**

    Install the SDK in your project:

    <CodeGroup>

```bash Using npm
npm i genuka-api
```

```bash Using yarn
yarn add genuka-api
```

```bash Using pnpm
pnpm add genuka-api
```

</CodeGroup>

    Then initialize it in your app:

    ```javascript
    import Genuka from "genuka-api";

    const genuka = await Genuka.initialize({ adminMode: true });
    
    genuka.setCompanyId(YOUR_COMPANY_IS);
    genuka.setToken(YOUR_ACCES_TOKEN);

    const orders = genuka.orders.list({ isAdmin: true }),
    console.log({orders})
    ```

    2. **Using the REST API directly**

    If you donâ€™t want to use the SDK, you can call the REST API with `fetch`, `axios`, or cURL:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://api.genuka.com/orders/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

    ðŸ‘‰ Choose the method that best fits your application stack.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up webhooks">
    To receive **real-time notifications** (e.g., when an order is created or completed), configure your webhook endpoint inside the dashboard. ðŸ‘‰ [Webhook Setup](/webhooks/setup)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go live ðŸš€">
    When you are ready, making modification of your app and submit in other section
  </Step>
</Steps>
