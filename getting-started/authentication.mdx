Proper authentication is essential to secure your Genuka integration. This guide explains how to authenticate your API requests, outlines error scenarios, and presents best practices.
We have several ways to authenticate our requests. We can either use the ```API Key``` or the ```token``` that we must add to the header.
In the following, we will present both methods.

## Using API Key authentication

Genuka uses API keys to authenticate requests. 

### How it works

1. You can find these in your **Genuka Dashboard -> Settings -> API Keys**.
2. Generate new key and copy it. 

### Example request

```bash 
curl -X GET "https://preprod-api.genuka.com/2023-11/orders" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Company: YOUR_COMPANY_ID" \
  -H "X-Shop: YOUR_SHOP_ID"
```


## Authentication with access token

Besides API keys, you can authenticate requests using an **Access Token**.  
This method is typically used when you authenticate a user via the Genuka platform and receive a token in return.


### How it works

1. Obtain an `access_token` after logging in or authenticating a user.  
2. Include the token in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent requests.  


### Example request

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.genuka.com/orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6..."
```

## Common Authentication Errors

If authentication fails, Genuka returns clear error messages:

| Error Scenario            | HTTP Code | Message                                             | Likely Cause                                  |
|----------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Missing API Key            | 401       | `"code": 401, "message": "API key is missing"`      | Authorization header not provided             |
| Invalid or Revoked Key     | 401       | `"code": 401, "message": "Invalid API key"`         | Wrong or expired API key                      |
