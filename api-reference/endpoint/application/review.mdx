### Review & Approval Process

When a developer submits a new application, it goes through an **internal review process** managed by the Genuka team.  
During this process, the application will be evaluated for compliance with our technical, security, and policy requirements.  

Depending on the outcome of the review, the application may receive one of the following statuses:  

- **Approved** ✅  
  The application meets all requirements and is validated by the Genuka team. Approved apps are granted **production API keys** and become visible on the **Genuka App Store**, making them available for other users and businesses to install and interact with.  

- **Rejected** ❌  
  The application does not meet the required standards (e.g., missing information, invalid URLs, insufficient description, or non-compliance with policies). In this case, the developer will be notified and may revise and resubmit the app.  

- **Deleted** 🗑️  
  The application has been permanently removed by the developer or by Genuka. Deleted apps cannot be restored and must be created again if needed.  

- **Trashed** 🗃️  
  The application has been moved to the trash (soft delete). It is no longer active or visible to users but can be restored by the developer within a certain period, or permanently deleted later.

### After Validation

Once an application is **approved**:  
- It appears in the **Genuka App Store** where other users and businesses can discover it.  
- Developers and users can start interacting with the app through the provided APIs, webhooks, and OAuth flows.  
- The app is fully functional in **production mode**.

Until approval, applications remain in **development mode**.
